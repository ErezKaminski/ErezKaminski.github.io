I am a Wolfram Technology Specalist at [Wolfram Research](https://www.wolfram.com), an amatur mountaineer and a **huge** book worm.

Formaly of the IDF, the [Birmingham-Southern College football team](http://www.bscsports.net/sports/fball/index) and the [Haifa Underdogs](http://www.haifaunderdogs.com/). I spend my time promoting the use of the Wolfram Language and discovering it's most cutting edge applications.
